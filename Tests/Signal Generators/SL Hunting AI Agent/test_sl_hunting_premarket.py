       from the previous note rather than the transcript would keep the
       direction and change only the levels, which is the whole plan wrong.
    2. FLAT is on the sell side. He gives the same plan for a flat open as for
       the gapped ones, so the sign of the gap does not switch the branch --
       the same structural point as yesterday, opposite direction.
    3. The premise is FOLLOW, not hunt, and it carries its reason: nobody is
       trapped (few trade puts here, and the closing price was not broken).
       "Sell-side, therefore hunt the buyers" keeps the direction and inverts
       the premise, which is the subtlest way to be wrong -- and it is exactly
       what v4o's THE METHOD IS NOT ALWAYS A FADE exists to prevent.
    4. BankNIFTY carries an explicit STAND-ASIDE on a gap-up that runs. A note
